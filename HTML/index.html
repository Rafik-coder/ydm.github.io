                            To discover is to see, find, or become aware of something for the first time.
                            Therefore, a group, family and community of Ghanaian youth are coming together to be nurtured on their talents. <br>
                            <br>
                            Anyone with a potential and is interested in Technology is welcome. <br>
                            Trust me! This is a place for you. You get to join a family concerned with bringing out the best in you.
                            <br><br>
                            The important lessons and activities offered by this movement are spectacular and worth every bit of your time.
                            <br><br>
                            It’s an entire package for the future.
                            Our main aim is to plug Ghana into the technology world.
                            Together with experts in the technological field,
                            we bring out fully nurtured talents and make dreams become a reality which will make <br>
                            a difference in the world to come.
                            Be prepared to be amazed at the warm welcome and exciting activities and projects taken up in this movement.

                            The world today runs on software: 
                            from office computers, electric cars, airplanes, factory robots, 
                            to smartphones and smart watches. They all run software, making 
                            computer programming the most vital skill in the Fourth Industrial 
                            Revolution. Today, all the youth of the world are being urged to 
                            learn coding.
                            <br><br>
                            We highly recommend Python, and the fastest way to know Python is with Python Turtle Graphics. (See examples in the slide show below).
                            <br><br>
                            Come and learn how to program. You’ll find out how interesting it is!

                            Robots are just computers with mechanical parts that can move!
                            But the computers they contain are a bit different than 
                            those like our laptops. The "brains" of robots are called 
                            "microcontrollers". Just like laptops, microcontrollers can be 
                            programmed in many languages, especially Python. Microcontrollers 
                            tell robots how to move, how to sense their environment, and how 
                            to communicate with humans. In education, they are very useful for 
                            teaching computer programming ("coding").
                            <br><br>
                            Automation is actually "robotics", and you would 
                            find many robotic machines in factories. So 
                            knowing robotics would prepare the youth for 
                            Ghana's industrialization. Fortunately these days, 
                            many high schools are forming robotics clubs. We all heard about 
                            Mamfe Methodist Girls SHS and Prempeh College winning the 
                            international robotics competition called Robofest!
                            <br><br>
                            The simplest robot easiest to program is 
                            the Maqueen Robot Car. The most expensive 
                            educational robot is the Robomaster EP Core, 
                            which can be programmed in any language and can 
                            communicate via the internet. The coolest robot 
                            is the Sphero RVR (from America, of course!), 
                            considered the "iPhone" of Robots. (See below for pictures of these three robots).

                            Just as humans have been linked together through 
                            the internet, devices too can be connected to the 
                            internet. But such devices must first be "smart". 
                            To become a smart device, the gadget must contain a 
                            tiny computer called "microcontroller". 
                            These microcontrollers also carry wi-fi chips, 
                            and so are able to connect to the internet . 
                            Some even have SIM cards and can send text messages 
                            to humans. IoT devices also have sensors (just as 
                            humans have eyes, ears, and noses). With sensors, 
                            IoT devices can monitor the environment and send the 
                            information to humans via the internet. For example, 
                            an IoT device in a farm can sense if the soil is 
                            getting too dry and automatically text the farmer 
                            to go and water the soil. Some can even automatically turn on the 
                            irrigation pumps without human intervention, when they sense soil 
                            dryness.
